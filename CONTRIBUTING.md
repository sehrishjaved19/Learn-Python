## 🧠 Guidelines

* Keep the **folder and file structure consistent** with existing topics.
  Example:

  ```
  ├── 08_Exceptions_Debugging/
  │   ├── 01_try_except.py
  │   ├── Practice_Exercises/
  │   └── README.md
  ```
* Name files **numerically and descriptively** (e.g., `02_date_time_module.py`).
* Add **comments or docstrings** to explain code purpose and logic.
* Include a **README.md** file when introducing a new topic or section.
* Avoid adding unnecessary third-party libraries unless relevant to the lesson.

## 🧾 Code Style

Follow these conventions:

* Use **snake_case** for variable and function names.
* Use **4 spaces** for indentation.
* Keep code clean, readable, and properly formatted.
* Add blank lines between logical sections of code.
* Use meaningful commit messages.
