# 🗂️ 03_Dictionaries_Sets

Welcome to the **Dictionaries and Sets** section!  
Dictionaries and Sets are powerful Python data structures designed for efficient data storage, lookup, and manipulation.  
In this section, you’ll explore how to store key-value pairs using dictionaries and manage unique elements using sets.

---

## 📘 Overview

You’ll learn:
- How to **create and access** dictionaries and sets.  
- The difference between **keys and values** in dictionaries.  
- Common **dictionary methods** for updating, removing, and iterating over data.  
- How **sets** automatically handle **unique elements** and support mathematical operations like union and intersection.  
- When to use each data structure in real-world coding.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:
- Use **dictionaries** to store and manage structured data.  
- Retrieve, update, and remove dictionary entries efficiently.  
- Understand how **sets** maintain unique values automatically.  
- Perform mathematical operations on sets.  
- Decide when to use dictionaries or sets in your Python programs.

## 💡 Practice Ideas

Try out these small projects:
- Create a dictionary to store student names and grades, then print the highest grade.  
- Merge two dictionaries using the `update()` method.  
- Use a set to remove duplicates from a list.  
- Find the common elements between two sets of numbers.
