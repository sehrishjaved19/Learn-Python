# 🗂️ 03_Dictionaries_Sets

Welcome to the **Dictionaries and Sets** section!
Dictionaries and Sets are powerful Python data structures used for efficient data storage, lookup, and manipulation.
In this section, you’ll learn how to work with **key-value pairs** in dictionaries and **unique elements** in sets — both essential for real-world programming.

## 📘 Overview

You’ll learn:

* How to **create and access** dictionaries and sets.
* The difference between **keys** and **values** in dictionaries.
* Common **dictionary methods** for adding, updating, or removing data.
* How **sets** automatically handle **unique elements**.
* Performing **mathematical operations** like union and intersection with sets.
* When to use each data structure in real-world coding.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:

* Use **dictionaries** to store and organize structured data efficiently.
* Retrieve, update, and remove dictionary elements effectively.
* Use **sets** for managing unique data collections.
* Apply **set operations** to filter or compare datasets.
* Choose between dictionaries and sets depending on your use case.

## 💡 Practice Ideas

Here are some ideas to strengthen your understanding:

* Create a dictionary storing student names and grades; print the top scorer.
* Merge two dictionaries and update common keys.
* Use a set to remove duplicate words from a text.
* Find the common, different, and unique items between two sets of numbers.
* Write a program to check whether two sets are disjoint.
