# 02_finally_else.py
# -------------------------------------
# Using else and finally blocks with try-except in Python
# -------------------------------------

# The 'else' block runs only if no exceptions occur inside the try block.
# The 'finally' block always runs, no matter what happens (success or error).
# 'finally' is often used for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.
