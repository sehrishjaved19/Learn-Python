#A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.
#Import the datetime module and display the current date:

import datetime
x = datetime.datetime.now()
print(x)

# The date contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.
# The datetime module has many methods to return information about the date object.

# Return the year and name of weekday:

import datetime
x = datetime.datetime.now()
print(x.year)
print(x.strftime("%A"))

# Creating Date Objects
# To create a date, we can use the datetime() class (constructor) of the datetime module.
# The datetime() class requires three parameters to create a date: year, month, day.
# Example
# Create a date object:

import datetime
x = datetime.datetime(2020, 5, 17)
print(x)


# The strftime() Method
# The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings.
# The method is called strftime(), and takes one parameter, format, to specify the format of the returned string:
# Example
# Display the name of the month:

import datetime
x = datetime.datetime(2018, 6, 1)
print(x.strftime("%B"))
