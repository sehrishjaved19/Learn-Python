# ðŸ§º 02_Lists_Tuples

Welcome to the **Lists and Tuples** section!
Lists and Tuples are two of Pythonâ€™s most commonly used **data structures**.
They allow you to store, organize, and manage collections of data efficiently â€” making them essential for almost every Python program youâ€™ll write.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

In this section, youâ€™ll explore:

* How to **create** and **work with** lists and tuples.
* The difference between **mutable (lists)** and **immutable (tuples)** data types.
* Common **list methods** used for adding, removing, and sorting elements.
* How to **iterate** through collections using loops.
* The concept of **unpacking** â€” assigning multiple variables from a single sequence.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

By completing this section, youâ€™ll be able to:
âœ… Create and manipulate lists effectively.
âœ… Understand and use tuples for fixed collections of items.
âœ… Apply list methods to organize and modify data.
âœ… Use **unpacking** for simple, elegant variable assignments.
âœ… Work confidently with sequences of varying lengths and data types.

## ðŸ’¡ Practice Ideas

Here are some fun exercises to try once you complete the lessons:

* Create a list of your favorite movies and print them using a loop.
* Sort a list of numbers in both ascending and descending order.
* Use tuple unpacking to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.
* Create a list of lists to represent students and their marks, then find the student with the highest marks.
* Try converting a tuple into a list and back again to understand mutability.
