# ðŸ§º 02_Lists_Tuples

Welcome to the **Lists and Tuples** section!  
Lists and Tuples are fundamental collection data types in Python that allow you to store and manage multiple items together.  
This section focuses on understanding how to create, access, modify, and work efficiently with sequences of data.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

In this section, youâ€™ll explore:
- How to **create lists and tuples**.
- The difference between **mutable (lists)** and **immutable (tuples)** sequences.
- Common **methods** to manipulate lists.
- How to **iterate** over lists and tuples using loops.
- Techniques for **nesting** and **unpacking** data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

By completing this section, youâ€™ll be able to:
- Understand when to use **lists** and when to use **tuples**.  
- Efficiently **manipulate lists** using built-in methods.  
- Use **tuple unpacking** for cleaner, more readable code.  
- Handle **nested structures** and access data precisely.

## ðŸ’¡ Practice Ideas

Here are a few ideas to strengthen your understanding:
- Create a list of your favorite movies and print them using a loop.  
- Sort a list of numbers in ascending and descending order.  
- Use tuple unpacking to assign values to multiple variables.  
- Create a list of lists representing student names and marks, then find the highest score.
