# âœ¨ 01_Strings

Welcome to the **Strings in Python** section!  
Strings are one of the most important and commonly used data types in Python.  
In this section, youâ€™ll learn how to create, modify, and manipulate text data efficiently using Pythonâ€™s built-in features and methods.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Here youâ€™ll explore:
- How to define and work with string variables.  
- Accessing characters using **indexing** and **slicing**.  
- Common **string methods** for searching, modifying, and formatting text.  
- Using **f-strings** and the `format()` method for dynamic output.  
- Handling **escape sequences** for special characters like newlines and tabs.
