# ðŸ§® 06_Functions_Recursion

Welcome to the **Functions and Recursion** section!  
This is one of the most powerful parts of Python â€” youâ€™ll learn how to structure your code into reusable, organized blocks using **functions**, and how functions can call themselves through **recursion**.  

Functions help make code **modular**, **readable**, and **efficient**, while recursion introduces problem-solving through repeated self-calls.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Youâ€™ll learn:
- How to **define and call functions** in Python.  
- How to use **parameters** and **return values** to make functions flexible.  
- The difference between **local** and **global** variables.  
- How **recursion** works and when itâ€™s useful.  
- The concept of **base cases** and how to avoid infinite recursion.

## ðŸ“‚ Practice Folder

### `Practice_Exercises/`
This folder contains practical coding challenges based on functions and recursion.  
Itâ€™s designed to help you strengthen your understanding through real exercises.  

Example challenges might include:
- Creating a function to calculate factorial or Fibonacci numbers.  
- Writing a recursive function to find the sum of natural numbers.  
- Building small utilities (e.g., greeting users, temperature conversion).

## ðŸ§  Example Code

```python
# Basic Function Example
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Sehrish")

# Function with Return Value
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print("Sum is:", result)

# Recursion Example
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print("Factorial of 5 is:", factorial(5))
```
