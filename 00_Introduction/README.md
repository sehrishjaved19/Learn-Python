# 🐍 00_Introduction

Welcome to the **Introduction to Python** section!
This is the **starting point** of your Python journey — where you’ll learn the fundamentals that power everything else in programming.
Here, you’ll write your **first Python program**, understand how **comments**, **variables**, and **data types** work, and explore how to handle **input/output** operations effectively.

## 📘 Overview

In this section, you’ll learn to:

* Understand what Python is and why it’s a beginner-friendly yet powerful language.
* Write and run your first **“Hello, World!”** program.
* Use **comments** to make your code readable and **modules** to extend functionality.
* Declare and manipulate **variables** and **data types**.
* Perform **typecasting** and handle **user input/output** gracefully.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:
✅ Write and execute Python scripts confidently.
✅ Understand and use variables and data types correctly.
✅ Perform type conversions and handle user input/output.
✅ Use comments and imports properly in your scripts.

## 💡 Practice Idea

Once you complete the lessons, head into the **Practice_Exercises** folder and try tasks like:

* Write a program that takes your name and age, then prints a personalized greeting.
* Create a simple calculator that adds two numbers entered by the user.
* Print a message using both **string concatenation** and **f-strings**.
* Use the `type()` function to check the data type of different variables.
